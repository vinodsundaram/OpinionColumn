Analysis on the opinion column articles written by "The Guardian" writers

Opinion columns are long piece articles published in newspapers or magazines. These articles are generally written by regular columnists who are people with subject matter experience. Such pieces may be strongly opinionated and tend to bring the authorâ€™s perspective on the issue. In this paper, we try to understand how authors write opinion columns, their opinion on different issues and personalities and their personal writing style over a period of time. We do an exploratory analysis on The Guardian columnists.

In this project involves data scrapping, detailed exploratory analysis using concepts of :
